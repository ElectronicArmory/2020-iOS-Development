# Final Project

This is your final for CS 402: Mobile Application Development. Your final is the project idea you chose and evolved based on feedbacks from various homework assignements.



## Requirements

4. You’ll be graded on the following areas:

   1. (1/3%) **Technology** - Implementing more technologies (Core Data, camera, location, web services, animations, sounds, SceneKit, HealthKit, CocoaPods, camera, location manager etc). The more the better. Since each app is different try to implement at least 3 major mobile technologies. If you’re unsure, ask!
   2. (1/3%) **Creative** - The design of the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and general creativity of the app, the idea and the implementation. Go to [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create) for color scheme ideas.
   3. (1/3%) **Originality** - How original is the idea, and the implementation. This is subjective, but if your app reproduces other apps, this will likely result in a lower grade for this area. Example: A restaurant finder is not very original, but a Boise restaurant finder for college students, with a bus schedule, may be more original. Also, the implementation of the app matters. 
   4. **5 minute presentation** 15 point penalty for missing this requirement.
   
   
   

## Grading

Satisfying all requirements will yield a score of 80%. Adding extra effort, features and time to the base requirements will allow for a score that is greater than the base score, at the instructor's discresion. If in doubt, ask! Guidance will be give as best as possible to the ideas proposed, but the final grade will be determined at implementation. Feel free to ask for a preliminary grading and feedback, if you submit early enough before the deadline.

## Submission

Xcode project with all required files, compiles, and works on various simulators. Must support rotation and different screen sizes. Xcode project must compile.
