# Homework 3

Based on homework 2's ideas that you generated, pick one to work on for the remainder of the semester.



## Requirements

You app, at a minimum must have the following requirements in order to achieve the base score.

1. App title. No more than 30 characters
2. App subtitle.
3. Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing your app. This is your elevator pitch to potential users to download and/or purchase your app.
4. 5 sketches or wireframes of different screens of your app. You can use a tool, mock it up in Storyboards, paper or pencil, or whatever you prefer to get the UI layed out.
5. Sketch or mockup of the logo. Can be hand-drawn or created in a graphics application. Feel free to explore logo creator tools, but the logo should reflect the application.
6. Choose an app category. Look these up from the iOS App Store categories ("News", "Food & Drink", "Sports" etc).
7. Keywords with a character count from 85-100 characters. Ex: "food,restaurant,food finder" Use:
    `echo "[list of keywords]" | wc -c`



## Grading

Satisfying all requirements will yield a score of 80%. Adding extra effort, features and time to the base requirements will allow for a score that is greater than the base score, at the instructor's discresion. If in doubt, ask! Guidance will be give as best as possible to the ideas proposed, but the final grade will be determined at implementation. Feel free to ask for a preliminary grading and feedback, if you submit early enough before the deadline.
