# Project 1

For this project, you'll come up with a theme around the requirements below. You can use this opportunity as a stepping stone for your final project. You can try out another idea that you'd like to implement or as a stand alone app that makes you excited.



## Requirements

You app, at a minimum must have the following requirements in order to achieve the base score.

1. Implement a location manager and use those coordinates in a visible-to-the-user way.
2. Implement the ability to add images (UIImageView) from the camera **and** photo library.
3. UI requirements
   1. UITableView with dynamic data
   2. Complex UIView (ex: MKMapView, UICollectionView, )

## Grading

Satisfying all requirements will yield a score of 80%. Adding extra effort, features and time to the base requirements will allow for a score that is greater than the base score, at the instructor's discresion. If in doubt, ask! Guidance will be give as best as possible to the ideas proposed, but the final grade will be determined at implementation. Feel free to ask for a preliminary grading and feedback, if you submit early enough before the deadline.

## Submission

Xcode project with all required files, compiles, and works on various simulators. Must support rotation and different screen sizes.
