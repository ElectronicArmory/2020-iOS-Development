# Project 2

For this project, you'll build upon Project 1 to add Core Data, to persist your app's data. You'll also allow your user to input data, which will then be persisted to the database. Essentially, you'll be retrofitting Project 1 with Core Data and preparing it for the App Store.



## Requirements

You app, at a minimum must have the following requirements in order to achieve the base score.

1. Add Core Data to Project 1.

2. Add a data model with at least 3 entities that have relationships with each other.

3. Add an app icon

4. Design a launch screen.

   

## Grading

Satisfying all requirements will yield a score of 80%. Adding extra effort, features and time to the base requirements will allow for a score that is greater than the base score, at the instructor's discresion. If in doubt, ask! Guidance will be give as best as possible to the ideas proposed, but the final grade will be determined at implementation. Feel free to ask for a preliminary grading and feedback, if you submit early enough before the deadline.

## Submission

Xcode project with all required files, compiles, and works on various simulators. Must support rotation and different screen sizes.
